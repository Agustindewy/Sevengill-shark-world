This repository contains code to reproduce analyses in De Wysiecki et al. (in review).

Analysis for SWA cannot be fully reproduced from scratch because a fraction of occurrences have confidentiality agreements in place and could not be released. However, models can be reproduced for SWA from the calibration step onwards using this calibration data. Analysis for AUS fully reproducible.

Global occurrence data is available in Appendix C. Calibration data is available in Appendix D.
