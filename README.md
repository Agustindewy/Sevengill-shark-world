This repository contains code to reproduce analyses in De Wysiecki et al. (accepted in L&O).

Analysis involving SWA data cannot be fully reproduced from scratch because a fraction of occurrences have confidentiality agreements in place and could not be released. However, models can be reproduced from the calibration step onwards using this calibration data. Analysis for AUS fully reproducible.

Global occurrence data and calibration data is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BvmFW0StZW8yoShi4eQBCltUYqOn7LA6?usp=sharing.
