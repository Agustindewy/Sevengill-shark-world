This repository contains code to reproduce analyses in De Wysiecki et al. (2022).

De Wysiecki AM, Cortés F, Jaureguizar AJ & Barnett A. 2022. Potential global distribution of a temperate marine coastal predator: the role of barriers and dispersal corridors on subpopulation connectivity. Limnology and Oceanography 67(8), 1805–1819. https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.12168

Analysis involving SWA data cannot be fully reproduced from scratch because a fraction of occurrences have confidentiality agreements in place and could not be released. However, models can be reproduced from the calibration step onward using this calibration data. Analysis for AUS is fully reproducible.

Global occurrence data and calibration data are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BvmFW0StZW8yoShi4eQBCltUYqOn7LA6?usp=sharing.
